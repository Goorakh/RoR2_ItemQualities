Introduces 4 new qualities for all white, green, red, and void items: Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary, each with unique additional effects on top of their standard versions.

#

Quality items have a small chance to drop from any regular item source, and always drop from Quality chest variants.

Quality printer variants allow you to trade a quality item for a different item, while keeping the quality tier the same.
